# Distributed Algorithms â€“ K-Means

This project implements the **K-Means|| algorithm** ([Bahmani et al., 2012](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.6402)) in the context of distributed algorithms.  
It was developed as part of the course **Physics of Data â€“ Management and Analysis of Physics Datasets (mod. B)**, academic year 2024â€“2025.

## ðŸ“– Project Description
The goal of this project is to implement and benchmark the **K-Means||** algorithm across a distributed system using **Dask**.

We also develop an **alternative version of K-Means||**, aiming to identify the optimal cluster configuration that maximizes efficient use of available resources.

## Datasets
- We tested our kmeans_dask library with a synthetic dataset based on dask_ml function **make_blobs**
